# Compromised

## Challenge description
While poking around a web service of one of the most popular DeFi projects in the space, you get a somewhat strange response from their server. This is a snippet:

![Timelock - attack upgrade](../../images/compromised-snippet.png)
A related on-chain exchange is selling (absurdly overpriced) collectibles called "DVNFT", now at 999 ETH each

This price is fetched from an on-chain oracle, and is based on three trusted reporters: 0xA73209FB1a42495120166736362A1DfA9F95A105, 0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15 and 0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c.

Starting with only 0.1 ETH in balance, you must steal all ETH available in the exchange.
